# exchange-price-diff
 A Rust project to compare the price differences between Gate and Binance exchanges. It fetches the top 10 levels of the order book and trade data from both exchanges, and writes the data into separate CSV files (4 files in total). This project helps identify potential arbitrage opportunities between the two exchanges.
